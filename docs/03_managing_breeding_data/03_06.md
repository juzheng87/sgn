Information for crosses can be managed using the “Crosses" option in the Manage menu.

Crosses are organized based on their breeding programs. To find a cross, you can either type the cross name in the “Search” box, or look for the cross directly in its breeding program by clicking on the “**+**” icon.

In each breeding program, crosses can be placed directly in the breeding program, or organized in folders.

Clicking the "**Add cross**" link will cause a new dialogue to pop up:

Information to fill out:

• “**Cross name”**: enter a name for the cross.

• “**Cross type”**: the options for cross types are: biparental, self, open pollinated, bulk, bulk selfed, bulk and open pollinated, and double haploid.

• The “**Maternal parent”** and “**paternal parent”** field are auto-complete fields for accessions that are already in the database. The parents specified will be entered in the pedigree of the new accessions generated by this cross.

• “**Breeding program”**: Select a breeding program that is available in the database. New breeding programs can be added on the "Breeding program" page, accessible from the "Manage" menu. *Breeding Program Page*

• “**Location**”: Select a location for the cross. New locations can be entered on the "**Locations**" page, accessible from the "**Manage**" menu. *Location Page*

If you know the number of accessions that are generated from the cross, they can be instantiated immediately in the database by clicking the "**Create accessions for progeny**" checkbox and specifying the number. Other options include number of flowers and number of seeds.

Click "Submit" to generate the cross.

The cross page should be displayed.

Cross Wishlist
-----------------

An Android ODK application is being developed to record cross information on a mobile device in the field. To link this mobile application with the database, the Cross Wishlist can be used to create a plan for which crosses to perform.

This tool is available on the Manage Cross page. It is currently only available on certain databases, so when you click this link you may see an alert mentioning that the cross wishlist is not available on your database.

### 3.6.1 Create a Cross Wishlist

#### Step 1. Select the accessions to be crossed in your trial

There are two interfaces for this step, either "Not Using Lists" or "Using Lists". Depending on if you already have a list of female and male accessions to use, you can decide on which interface to use. The end result of using either interface is the same.

We will start by showing "Not Using Lists". First select the trial in which the crosses are to be performed. This will populate a select box with all the accessions used in that trial. From here, one or many accessions can be selected as the female accession.

Once the female accessions are selected, a table is populated. Each row in this table begins with the female accession that was selected, followed by a select box with all the accessions used in the trial. From here, one or many accessions can be selected as the male to use in the cross.

Once the male accessions are selected to cross with each female accession, a table indicating priorities appears. Priority is meant to indicate an order in which to attempt the cross; first the highest priority male will be considered, but if this cross is not possible then subsequent males will be considered. An equal priority can be given and this will not indicate a specific order to follow.

Alternatively, we could have used the "Using List" interface instead. Here we select the trial in which the crosses will be performed and we provide a list of accessions to consider for the females and the males to be crossed.

#### Step 2. Select the female plots to be considered in the crosses

After selecting your lists, the table below is populated. The first column has all the female accessions specified and the header row has all the male accessions specified. The males to consider crossing with each female are indicated with priority.

After female and male accessions are selected to cross, either by the "Nor Using List" or "Using List" interface, click Next. The next dialog will allow selection of specific female plots to use for the cross. Sections for each female accession selected will appear with the field layout displayed. Selecting all plots in which the female is present indicates that the cross should be performed on all plots where that female accession is present.

#### Step 3. Transfer the cross wishlist to your mobile crossing application

Clicking "Push Cross Wishlst for ODK Use" will send the cross wishlist plan to the ONA server for use by the mobile ODK application. Crosses can then be performed and recorded in the field using the mobile application. Afterwards, the crosses are sent back to our database and stored.

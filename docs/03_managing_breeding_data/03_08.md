If you have a list of stocks that you want to generate barcodes, you can use “Download Stock Barcodes” section. You have three options for entering stock names:

1.  Typing in stock names, or copy and paste from other file into the box (1)

2.  Choosing a list of stocks from your “Lists” (2), and transferring the list into the box (1) by clicking on “paste” button.

3.  Uploading a “Tab-delimited Text File” with stock names.

You can select printer settings that you prefer in the “Printer Settings” section. After you enter stock names and specify printer settings, clicking on “Download Barcodes” button at the bottom of the page.

Adding Trials
-------------

Only users with the account status of "submitter" may create trials. To learn how to change your account status from "user" to "submitter" visit the [*Managing Your Account*]({{site.baseurl}}{% link 01_basic_website_usage.md%}#managing-your-account) page.

### Prerequisites

-   To add a trial, all of your accessions should already exist in the database before you begin to design a trial. If you have accessions that are not in the database, see the instructions for adding accessions .

-   Breeding program and location for your trial should also exist in the database. If you need to add breeding program and/or location to the database, see instructions for adding breeding program and location in the “Managing Breeding Programs” and “Managing locations” respectively.

On the “Manage Trials” page, there are three alternative methods for you to add new trials: by using “Add Trial” form, “Upload Trial” form, or “Add Multi-location Trial” form.

![]({{"assets/images/image140.png" | relative_url }})

### 3.5.1 Adding a trial by using “Add Trial” form

#### Step 1. Creating a list of accessions to use in the trial

To create a new trial, you need to create a list of the accessions that you would like to use in the trial. Lists can be viewed, created, and modified with the "**lists**" tool at the upper right of the screen. For more information on lists, click [*here*]({{site.baseurl}}{% link 01_basic_website_usage.md%}#working-with-lists).

![]({{"assets/images/image339.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 2. Opening the "Add Trial" form

Clicking on “Add Trial” will open the “Add New Trial” form.

![]({{"assets/images/image242.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 3. Specifying trial name, breeding program, location, year and description for the trial

Trial name, breeding program, location, year and description of the trial are mandatory fields. You can select a breeding program, location and year from the drop-down list.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_create_form_top.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 4. Selecting the type of experimental design.

-   Choose a design type from the drop-down menu. Which design type you select depends on the requirements of your trial.

![]({{"assets/images/image137.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 5. Selecting the list of accessions to use in your trial.

-   Select the list of accessions that you want to use in the trial. This list was created in step 1, [*here*]({{site.baseurl}}{% link 01_basic_website_usage.md%}#working-with-lists). If accessions are not in the database, an error message will be displayed. For the augmented design, you must also select a list of stocks to use as controls.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_create_form_accessions.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 6. Select the list of seedlots to plant in your trial (Optional).

-   You can specify a list of seedlots to use in your trial. Seedlots represent seed that is available to use from inventories. This is optional and can also be added from the trial detail page afterwards.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_create_form_seedlots.png" | relative_url }})

-   If you do not have a list of seedlots ready to use, you can click "Search seedlots for accessions". This will search the database for seedlots of your accessions and allows you to easily view and select the seedlots you want to plant in your trial.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_create_search_seedlots.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 7. Specifying parameters of the experimental design.

-   Specify the parameters that are required for the selected experimental design. The parameters that are required will depend on which design type you chose above.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_create_form_design_params.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 8. Generate plot row and column numbers (Optional).

-   You can generate row and column numbers for the plots automatically. This allows us to represent your field in a grid-like display. This is optional and can be added from the trial detail page afterwards. Also, if later you find that the way the plots were planted is different than what was generated, you can delete the row and number columns, and then upload the correct values on the trial detail page.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_create_form_fieldmap.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 9. Customize the way plots are named (Optional).

-   Options to customize plot naming are available. You may specify a prefix, starting number, and increment number. For example, every plot could begin with "exampleprefix", the first plot could be \#1000, and the second plot could be \#1010. This is optional and the defaults can safely be used.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_create_form_custom_plot_naming.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 10. Verifying that the trial design is correct before adding it to the database.

-   After you complete the “Add New Trial” form, click on "Design Trial” button at the bottom of the page.

-   Please check that all information on the “Confirm Trial Design” page is correct. You can view trial layout by clicking on “View Trial Layout” button.

#### Step 11. Add Field Management Factors to your design (Optional).

-   You can add Field Management Factors by clicking "Add Field Management Factor(s) to Design". Clicking this opens a dialog to name your factor. You can name this to account for fertilizer or watering regime or inoculation or anything else. This is optional and can be added from the trial detail page afterwards.

![]({{"assets/images/add_management_factor_name_dialog.png" | relative_url }})

-   Click "Continue" and a dialog will appear where you can specify plots for which the factor was applied. There is a select all button also.

![]({{"assets/images/add_management_factor_dialog.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 12. Saving new trial in the database. 

-   If all information is correct, click on “Confirm” button.

-   The following message is displayed after the trial is saved.

#### File requirements

-   All accession names in the file must exist in the database. See adding accessions for more information.

-   The uploaded file should be XLS file format.

-   The first row (header) must contain the column names: plot_name accession_name plot_number block_number is_a_control rep_number range_number row_number col_number seedlot_name num_seed_per_plot

Example:

| **plot\_name** | **accession\_name** | **plot\_number** | **block\_number** | **is\_a\_control** | **rep\_number** | **range\_number** | **row\_number** | **col\_number** | **seedlot\_name** | **num\_seed\_per\_plot** |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| plot1          | my_accession1       | 101              | 1                 | 1                  |                 |                   |                 |                 |                   |                          |
| plot2          | my_accession2       | 201              | 2                 |                    |                 |                   |                 |                 |                   |                          |
| plot3          | my_accession2       | 102              | 1                 |                    |                 |                   |                 |                 |                   |                          |

#### File validation

-   In case of errors in the uploaded file such as missing or invalid data, a window will appear listing the specific errors in the file that must be corrected before a successful upload.

#### Uploading a trial with Field Management Factors

-   You can upload a trial with field management factor(s) by adding additional column(s). The column header will be the factor e.g. fertilizer, watering regime, inoculation, etc. and the values in these columns will be either 1 or empty, indicating that the factor was applied to the plot or not.

### 3.5.3 Adding a trial with multiple locations

If you conduct field trial in more than one site, you can add your trial into the database by using “Add Multi-location Trial” form.

![]({{"assets/images/image136.png" | relative_url }})

In the “Add Multi-location Trial” form, all locations in the database are displayed in the location box. You can select multiple locations for your trial.

![]({{"assets/images/image345.png" | relative_url }})

### 3.5.4 Adding additional information in the “Trial Detail” page

After you added a new trial to the database, you can edit trial details or add more information for that trial through the“Trial Detail” page.

#### Uploading Physical Trial Layout

You can upload physical trial layout by clicking on the “Upload trial coordinates” button on the “Trial Detail” page.

### 3.5.5 Downloading the Trial Layout from the “Trial Detail” page

Click on "Download Layout" on the Trial Detail page.

![]({{"assets/images/image348.png" | relative_url }})

The trial layout includes all information regarding the observation units in the experiment. The observation units can be plots, plants, or subplots. The trial layout can include trial design information such as the block_number and rep_number. It can also include physical map information such as the row_number and col_number, if that information is available for the trial.
The trial layout also includes information regarding treatments that have been applied in the field.
Optionally, the layout can give information regarding accession's global performance for a list of traits.

![]({{"assets/images/image347.png" | relative_url }})

### 3.5.6 Adding Plant Entries To Your Trial

After you added a new trial to the database you can choose to add plant entries to your trial. Adding plant entries enables plant level phenotyping. It is generally better to enter data at the plant level into the database because it is always possible to calculate plot level phenotypes from the individual plant data.

Plant entries can be added to your trial in two ways:
1) Automatically generated by the database. The only input required is the number of plants per plot.
2) Uploaded in an XLS file. This allows you to specifically name your plant entries.

These two options are available in the "Plant Entries" section on the Trial Detail Page, as shown in the screen shot below.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_detail_page_add_plant_entries.png" | relative_url }})

#### Automatically Generate Plant Entries 

Clicking on "Add plant entries" opens the following dialog box. The only input required is the number of plants per plot. This will create plant entries that are named as a concatenation of the plot_name and the plant's index number e.g. plot_name_plant_1

![]({{"assets/images/trial_detail_page_add_plant_entries_autogenerated.png" | relative_url }})

#### Upload Plant Entries 

Alternatively, you can choose to upload an XLS file that contains the names of the plant entries. Clicking on "Upload plant entries" opens the following dialog box.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_detail_page_add_plant_entries_upload.png" | relative_url }})

Clicking on "Spreadsheet format" will give you information about the XLS file to upload. Clicking this will open the following dialog box.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_detail_page_add_plant_entries_upload_info.png" | relative_url }})

This shows you that the files requires the header to contain "plot_name" and "plant_name". The plot_name must exist in the database already and the plant_name must be unique in the database.

Along with the file, you must specify "number of plants per plot". This is intended to be the total number of plants that were plants. If the file you upload shows three plants in one plot and four plants in another plot, that is fine.

### 3.5.7 Uploading GPS Coordinates For Plots

You can upload GPS coordinates for the plots in your trial. There is a link on the Trial Detail Page as shown below.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_detail_page_add_plot_gps.png" | relative_url }})

Clicking on this link will bring up the following dialog.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_detail_page_add_plot_gps_dialog.png" | relative_url }})

Here you can upload an XLS file. To see information on the format of the file that should be uploaded, click on "Spreadsheet format". This will bring up the following dialog.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_detail_page_add_plot_gps_upload_info.png" | relative_url }})

This dialog tells you that the file must be XLS and must contain: plot_name	WGS84_bottom_left_x	WGS84_bottom_left_y	WGS84_bottom_right_x	WGS84_bottom_right_y	WGS84_top_right_x	WGS84_top_right_y	WGS84_top_left_x	WGS84_top_left_y
The GPS coordinates should be WGS84 format and specify a four-pointed polygon around the plot.

### 3.5.8 Viewing Phenotype HeatMap

Phenotype heatmap can be viewed by selecting a specific assayed trait from the trait selectbox drop-down. Mousing over the plots, highlights the plot in green and also displays the plot's field information including the selected trait's phenotype value. 

![]({{"assets/images/trial_detail_page_trait_heatmap.png" | relative_url }})

### Suppressing Plot Phenotype

Clicking on a plot on the heatmap would display a dialog that has a button for suppressing a plot phenotype value for a given trait. A suppressed plot value can be excluded during trial analysis and phenotype download.

![]({{"assets/images/trial_detail_page_suppress_phenotype.png" | relative_url }})

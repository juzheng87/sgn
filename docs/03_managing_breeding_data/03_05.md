![]({{"assets/images/image290.png" | relative_url }})

Clicking on the "Field Trials" link will bring you to the "Manage Trials" page. On this page, trials are organized according to their breeding programs. To access trial details, click on the + icon next to your breeding program.

![]({{"assets/images/image153.png" | relative_url }})

Trials can be placed directly in their breeding program. Alternatively, they can be organized by using folders within each breeding program. Clicking on trial name will take you directly to the trial details page.

Trial Detail Page
-----------------

Trial detail page displays important information about individual trial including breeding program, location, year, description of the trial, design, and any files associated with that trial.

Adding Trials
-------------

Only users with the account status of "submitter" may create trials. To learn how to change your account status from "user" to "submitter" visit the [*Managing Your Account*]({{site.baseurl}}{% link 01_basic_website_usage.md%}#managing-your-account) page.

### Prerequisites

-   To add a trial, all of your accessions should already exist in the database before you begin to design a trial. If you have accessions that are not in the database, see the instructions for adding accessions .

-   Breeding program and location for your trial should also exist in the database. If you need to add breeding program and/or location to the database, see instructions for adding breeding program and location in the “Managing Breeding Programs” and “Managing locations” respectively.

On the “Manage Trials” page, there are three alternative methods for you to add new trials: by using “Add Trial” form, “Upload Trial” form, or “Add Multi-location Trial” form.

### 3.5.1 Adding a trial by using “Add Trial” form

#### Step 1. Creating a list of accessions to use in the trial

To create a new trial, you need to create a list of the accessions that you would like to use in the trial. Lists can be viewed, created, and modified with the "**lists**" tool at the upper right of the screen. For more information on lists, click [*here*]({{site.baseurl}}{% link 01_basic_website_usage.md%}#working-with-lists).

![]({{"assets/images/image339.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 2. Opening the "Add Trial" form

Clicking on “Add Trial” will open the “Add New Trial” form.

![]({{"assets/images/image242.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 3. Specifying trial name, breeding program, location, year and description for the trial

Trial name, breeding program, location, year and description of the trial are mandatory fields. You can select a breeding program, location and year from the drop-down list.

![]({{"assets/images/image186.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 4. Selecting the type of experimental design.

-   Choose a design type from the drop-down menu.

![]({{"assets/images/image137.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 5. Selecting the list of accessions.

-   Select the list of accessions that you want to use in the trial. This list was created in step 1, [*here*]({{site.baseurl}}{% link 01_basic_website_usage.md%}#working-with-lists). If accessions are not in the database, an error message will be displayed. For the augmented design, you must also select a list of stocks to use as controls.

![]({{"assets/images/image280.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 6. Specifying parameters of the experimental design.

-   Specify the parameters that are required for the selected experimental design.

![]({{"assets/images/image70.png" | relative_url }})

Options to customize plot naming are available. You may specify a prefix, starting number, and increment number. In this example, every plot would begin with "exampleprefix", the first plot would be \#1000, and the second plot would be \#1010.

![]({{"assets/images/image299.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 7. Verifying that the trial design is correct before adding it to the database.

-   After you complete the “Add New Trial” form, click on “Add Trial” button at the bottom of the page.

-   Please check that all information on the “Confirm Trial Design” page is correct. You can view trial layout by clicking on “View Trial Layout” button.

![]({{"assets/images/image139.png" | relative_url }})

-   An example of the “Trial Design Layout” page

![]({{"assets/images/image84.png" | relative_url }})

#### Step 8. Saving new trial in the database. 

-   If all information is correct, close the trial design layout window and click on “Confirm” button.

-   The following message is displayed after the trial is saved.

### 3.5.2 Adding a trial from an uploaded file

If you already have trial design layout in a spreadsheet, you can add your trial into the database by using “Upload Trial” form. To access “Upload Trial” form, click on “Upload Trial” button on the “Manage Trials” page.

![]({{"assets/images/image23.png" | relative_url }})

Please read file format information carefully. To access file format information, click on “Spreadsheet format”

![]({{"assets/images/image275.png" | relative_url }})

**IMPORTANT!** Only Excel file (.xls) can be uploaded, .xlsx file format is not supported.

![]({{"assets/images/image132.png" | relative_url }})

#### File requirements

-   All stock names in the file must exist in the database. See adding stocks for more information.

-   The uploaded file should be tab delimited or comma delimited (CSV).

-   The first row (header) must contain the column names

Example:

| **plot\_name**   | **block\_number**   | **rep\_number**   | **stock\_name**   |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| plot1            | 1                   | 1                 | example\_stockA   |
| plot2            | 1                   | 2                 | example\_stockB   |
| plot3            | 2                   | 1                 | example\_stockC   |

#### File validation

In case of errors in the uploaded file such as missing or invalid data, a window will appear listing the specific errors in the file that must be corrected before a successful upload.

### 3.5.3 Adding a trial with multiple locations

If you conduct field trial in more than one site, you can add your trial into the database by using “Add Multi-location Trial” form.

![]({{"assets/images/image136.png" | relative_url }})

In the “Add Multi-location Trial” form, all locations in the database are displayed in the location box. You can select multiple locations for your trial.

### 3.5.4 Adding additional information in the “Trial Detail” page

After you added a new trial to the database, you can edit trial details or add more information for that trial through the“Trial Detail” page.

#### Uploading Physical Trial Layout

You can upload physical trial layout by clicking on the “Upload trial coordinates” button on the “Trial Detail” page.

![]({{"assets/images/image348.png" | relative_url }})

The trial layout includes all information regarding the observation units in the experiment. The observation units can be plots, plants, or subplots. The trial layout can include trial design information such as the block_number and rep_number. It can also include physical map information such as the row_number and col_number, if that information is available for the trial.
The trial layout also includes information regarding treatments that have been applied in the field.
Optionally, the layout can give information regarding accession's global performance for a list of traits.

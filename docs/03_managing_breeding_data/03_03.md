### *IMPORTANT!* Before entering a stock

**Before you enter a new stock, make sure that the stock does not already exist in the database. Please use the "Search Accessions” link to search for the stock by name and several possible synonyms. *Enter the stock only if you don't find it in the database!***

Clicking on “Search Accessions” will redirect you to the “Search Accessions and Plots” page, which you can check if the accessions that you want to enter already exist in the database.

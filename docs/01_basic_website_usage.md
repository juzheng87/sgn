1.4. Working with Lists {#working-with-lists}
-----------------------

Lists are collections of identifiers that are stored in the database. Lists can be composed of accessions, plots, traits, locations, and trials. Lists are attached to the individual user's account, and can only be created and seen by the user while logged in. CassavaBase makes heavy use of lists in a number of tools on the website. For example, trials are created using lists of accessions.

### Generating lists

**IMPORTANT: You can add only items that are stored in the database into your lists.**

Lists can be generated in various ways:

One way to create a list is by clicking on the "Lists" link located on the toolbar.

<img src='{{"assets/images/image180.png" | relative_url }}' alt="list1.png" width="624" height="102" />

To create a new list, entering the name of your new list, then clicking on “New List” button.

<img src='{{"assets/images/image176.png" | relative_url }}' alt="list2.png" width="624" height="153" />

You can find the list that you entered on the “Your Lists” page. To add items on your list, clicking on the view icon to open “List Contents” page.

<img src='{{"assets/images/image323.png" | relative_url }}' alt="list3.png" width="624" height="158" />

On the “List Contents” page, entering items that you want to add to the list, then clicking on “Add” button.

<img src='{{"assets/images/image13.png" | relative_url }}' alt="list4.png" width="624" height="258" />

The page will be updated and will display your items in a table at the bottom of the page.

<img src='{{"assets/images/image80.png" | relative_url }}' alt="list6.png" width="624" height="228" />

Selecting the type of items in your list. To verify that the items that you added to your list are already stored in the database and that you selected a correct type for the items, clicking on the “Validate” button.

<img src='{{"assets/images/image145.png" | relative_url }}' alt="list5.png" width="624" height="224" />

If those items are already in the database, a message will indicate that “This list passed validation”

<img src='{{"assets/images/image346.png" | relative_url }}' alt="list9.png" width="523" height="111" />

Note that a list cannot contain duplicate elements. If a duplicate item is entered, the list manager will inform the user that the element is already in the list and will not add it again.

Another easy way to create a list is to use the [*Search Wizard*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link 02_searching_the_database.md %}#search-wizard), which can be accessed from the Search menu.

### Viewing and editing lists

Lists can be viewed and edited using the "Lists" link on the toolbar. Clicking on the link will open a window that displays all of your lists, as well as an option to create new lists.

<img src='{{"assets/images/image71.png" | relative_url }}' alt="list8.png" width="624" height="196" />

This page shows all lists that have been created, including those created by using the Search Wizard. You can view and edit your lists by using “Actions” buttons.

1. Clicking on the "view" icon will open a new window called "List Contents" that allows you to change the list name, the type of the list, add new items, or delete existing items.

2. Clicking on the “delete” icon will delete your list. **Caution: this action cannot be undone**.

3. Clicking on the “download” icon will download the contents of your list to your computer.

4. Clicking on the “make public” icon will make your list available for other users to view and use your list.
